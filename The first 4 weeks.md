# The First 4 Weeks
## This is my second blog of my journey as a Summer Research Fellow under IASc-INSA-NASI SRFP 2023. Here, I have briefed about the first month I spent at research lab, including my training and allotment of problem statement.
### Training and Introduction
My first 10 days were for my training and Introduction. There were three research scholars, a senior scientist and few research interns in the Cyber Physical Systems lab. I realized I was the youngest in the lab. I met my mentor Dr. Geetika Jain Saxena on the second day where we discussed about the field of research.
The training included learning about Machine learning, Data analysis and feature extraction to familiarize myself with their basics through various courses on youtube and Kaggle and to complete certain tasks associated to them . I was able to complete the machine learning and data analysis tasks after thoroughly studying it for almost a week.
The ML task included implementing ML model on [framingham heart disease](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/framcohort/) dataset while the data analysis task included performing Exploratory data analysis on a PCOS dataset.
### Allotment of the first Problem Statment
After the training period, I was allotted my first problem statement  that was based on scene reconstruction. Scene Reconstruction is a problem in computer vision where one tries to model the whole 3-D scenario using multiple 2-D images of it.
The bigger idea was to construct 3-D medical images of tumor and cancer from their X-rays or CT scans to have a better visualization and understanding of the issue.
I tried to work on this problem for almost a week. I read research articles on scene reconstruction and photogrammetry, tried to look for datasets on kaggle and [Github](https://github.com/KesharwaniArpita/photogrammetry_datasets). But the truth was I did not find the problem relatable and interesting. Therefore, working on a problem that doesn't interest you is difficult.
### Current Problem Statement
After a week, my mentor changed my problem statement seeing my disengagement. This time, I indeed have an intriguing problem statement of: Detection of Hypertensive Retinopathy from fundoscopy images of the retina.
Hypertensive Retinopathy is an illness of the retina which occurs due to High Blood Pressure or hypertension and prompts vision loss. HR damages the eyes by arteriolar narrowing, retinal hemorrhage, macular edema, cotton wool spots and swollen blood vessels. If detected at an early stage, the effect can be reversed.
The analysis of HR mostly relies on manual inspection of the Fundus images obtained from fundoscopy and experience of the ophthalmologists. This is where my research work fits in. 
A Deep Learning based approach is necessary to assist ophthalmologists to analyze the progression of disease.
