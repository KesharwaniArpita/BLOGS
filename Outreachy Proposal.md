## Abstract

Scribe is a community of language enthusiasts, learners and developers creating tools to help people communicate with confidence.

Scribe is an innovative language learning tool, currently available as an iOS app, that provides real-time grammar and translation assistance for seven languages: French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Scribe utilizes data from Wikidata’s lexicographical data to provide accurate grammar and language assistance.

<!-- Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia, provides information on a broad spectrum of topics and is maintained by a global community of volunteers. Wikipedia offers translation services to make content accessible in multiple languages, powered by volunteers and machine translation. However, there is an imbalance in translations, with a large number of articles being translated from dominant languages, such as English, to languages with smaller Wikipedia presences. This project will explore these imbalances and investigate the underlying causes. 

## Extension

In addition to research, I will conduct UX research through interviews with translators to understand how their language choices are influenced by language importance. I will also explore how the software design impacts the translation workflow and language selection.-->

## Past Experience with Open Source Software

I worked as an MLH fellow during the Fall of 2023 for the Apache Airflow community in the SWE-23—fall.A.1 pod. The project was in collaboration with the Royal Bank of Canada(RBC). I Configured and documented processes and commands and developed Python-based scripts from BASH, improving code standardization. Before that, I was a contributor to a PyData community called Bokeh. Bokeh is a powerful interactive visualization library for Python, where I created more example graphs and worked on documentation enhancement. 

## About the Project

The Scribe community develops tools for language learners, focusing on apps like Scribe-iOS, which provides translation and verb conjugation functionalities through multilingual keyboards. The community is also expanding to Scribe-Android and Scribe-Desktop.

Scribe-Data serves as the backend, sourcing language data primarily from Wikidata and Wikipedia to power these applications. This project aims to expand Scribe-Data's functionality by integrating Wiktionary data, specifically focusing on:

- Translation commands that parse Wiktionary for translations in various languages and moving on from the machine translations.
- We are creating Synonym commands to derive word synonyms from Wiktionary.

The project will include tasks such as:

- Writing SPARQL queries and formatting data for both Scribe-Data users and Scribe-iOS/Android apps.
- Writing unit tests to ensure future code changes don’t break functionality.
- Ensuring efficient parsing of Wiktionary dumps and updating data notices to respect Wiktionary's license.
This effort will enhance the Scribe suite's language learning capabilities, offering more robust tools for translation and synonyms.

## Timeline

## About Me

I am a final-year student pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology and Mathematical Innovation at the Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi.  I am a budding researcher with interests in inter-disciplinary fields of AI, mathematics, bioinformatics, and innovation management. I have worked on Free and Open-source projects too and been a Major 
League Hacking Fellow in Fall 2023.  I am an active member of the coding society at CIC where we have built an ecosystem of peer-learning and have also helped in organising numerous workshop and technical fests.

## Past Projects


## How did I learn about Outreachy?
Our college has a strong culture of contributing to open source, which inspired me to get involved in open-source communities like Wikimedia. As I explored more about the communities, I realised what kind of an impact they make into people's lives which further motivated me to be a part of this community and start my part of contributions. I came to know about Outreachy from a college senior, who interned at Outreachy and contributed to Inkscape in 2021. She told me about the program and also about how it supports diversity in free and open source software which got my interest and I started to work in this direction. I have a friend, also a classmate who has been an Outreachy intern for WMF in 2023 and a junior who interned at WMF in summer 2024 through Outreachy only. I have also contributed to FOSS and we all agree to the fact that Open source is a field of growth and learning.
