# My beginning as a Summer research fellow under IASc
### This blog will cover the highlights of the beginning of my journey as a IASc-INSA-NASI SRF 2023 including the application process, selection and acceptance of SRFP, and what did I do between the application submission and final selection.
Indian academy of sciences is one of the best and renowned bodies for scientific research in India. Students from over all the country find it their dream to be a part of this prestigious institute in any form. I, Arpita, rather saw it as step in the long scheme of steps. Speaking honestly, I couldn't have any less idea about the IASc-INSA-NASI body (not a research buddy TBH).
## Introduction
Before moving forwards, let me introduce myself, I am Arpita Kesharwani, a dreamer, born in the sacred town of Prayagraj (Allahabad), brought up in the National capital. I am an undergraduate student at Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi, pursuing B.Tech in IT and mathematical innovation and I am a SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOW under IASc-INSA-NASI 2023. Well, many readers might have this question that why am I even writing this blog. And the answer is: I wanted to. I wanted to pen down a journey that I didn't know hold so much prestige in its name.
## How I came to know about IAS SRFP?
I had never been a research enthusiast. It was after coming to CIC, I was introduced to the field of research. Though I never took any interest in it. It was in December 2022, when I was applying for CERN (which I couldn't get in), a friend of mine who is a research geek told me about this opportunity called "Indian academy of sciences fellowship" and sent me a link so that I can apply. And without putting much thought, I did. Even though being not much interested, I didn't want to leave any stone unturned and leave this opportunity. I had to do something in summer.
## The application process:
So, I clicked on the link and it directed me to the application portal where I had to choose between many intriguing STEM fields to work on. Being a B.tech student who was fairly good in Mathematics and Computer programming, I went for "Computer science and engineering". And Viola! A form came up, where I had to fill my personal and academic details and particular field(s) of interest and my project(s) in the field(s).<br>
I filled my details as required. For the field of interest part; I filled up machine learning and artificial intelligence as I had a major project that did in ML and AI. The project involved classification of youtube videos into educatinal and entertainment categories. The approach used was NLP using the extracted titles and description of the videos. <br>
The further application required a letter of recommendation from any of my professors. For that, we reached out to the director of CIC, Prof. Shobha Bagai and she sent the LOR from her side. With this, I submitted my application, with too no expectations but hopes. :):):)
## What happened before I finally got selected?
Before my final selection, IAS did release its first few lists of selected fellows and I along with my two friends who also had applied couldn't find our names in it. But it didn't discourage us as we had many things ahead of us at that time.<br>
After the submission, I worked on two more major projects that taught me a lot of things. The first one was Frieze Pattern generation and recognition, which is a problem related to computer vision and involved image processing and pattern recognition.<br>
The second one, I worked as an OUTREACHY Contributor. My first time working in the field of open source, that too with so many diverse people. There I worked with Bokeh community on data visualization for 2 months. But, I couldn't get selected as an outreach intern. And I got really upset after that (It was something I really wanted).<br>
## Selection and Acceptance of the Fellowship:
It was 21st of April, 10:20 am, I was attending my class on probability and statistics, a notification on my mobile phone popped. It was my mail, from Indian academy of Sciences, offering me fellowship for the two months. I was really surprised when I received the mail because I never expected it, not after I didn't fine my name on previous lists. I was assigned to work under Dr. Geetika Jain Saxena of Maharaja Agrasen College, UOD.<br>
The same day I checked if everything was real, and when I found out it was, I conveyed my acceptance of the fellowship through the portal link provided in the mail. Three days later, I received a courier from IASc Bangalore, containing an offer letter, Instruction letter, acceptance form and joining report. I had to courier the acceptance for as soon as I receive it, and so I did the very next day; and the joining report was to be courier as soon as I join, signed by the mentor.<br>
Soon, I talked to my mentor and stated that I could only join after the completion of my end semester exams. I joined from 29th of May. And my journey as a research fellow began.
