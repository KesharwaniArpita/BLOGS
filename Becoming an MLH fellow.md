# Becoming an MLH fellow
Hi!! I am Arpita Kesharwani. And recently I became an MLH fellow!!! This blog contains information about MLH fellowship and how I became a part of it. 
## What is MLH Fellowship?
MLH Fellowship is a fully paid remote 12-week program participants learn to collaborate on real open source projects with peers and engineers from top companies like Github, Solana, Google, Meta, etc. It's collaborative, remote, & happens under the guidance of expert mentors. The stipend is upto 5000USD keeping in mind the purchasing-power-parity of USD in the fellow's resident country.
There are three fellowship tracks:
1. Software Engineering: For aspiring Software Engineers who want to experience what it's like to collaborate on real-world projects from our partners.
2. Site Reliability Engineering: For aspiring SREs who want to learn the skills required to keep systems running at scale.
3. Web3 Engineering: For hackers who want to dive deep into blockchain technology.

It runs thrice a year in sessions namely: Spring, Summer and Fall.([Src](https://fellowship.mlh.io/))
### OK, But Why is it important?
Major League Hacking (MLH) is a mission-driven organization empowering the next generation of technologists. MLH runs the largest community of early-career developers worldwide with more than 500,000 members. Through hackathons, fellowships, and workshops, community members count on MLH to gain practical hands-on experience, build their professional networks, and ultimately launch their careers.([Src](https://sponsor.mlh.io/))

The MLH Fellowship is important because it empowers individuals with the knowledge, experience, and network needed to thrive in the tech industry, promotes diversity and inclusion, and fosters a culture of continuous learning and innovation.
## How did I make it through?
So, I applied. The application process has 5 steps in it. Form filling-Application Review-Personal interview-Technical interview-Project Matching.<br>
Step-1) Form Filling: The form for the session can be found at MLH Website. The candidate has to fill the general information, CV/Resume, their time commitments in the initial part of the application. Then comes the section which asks for a project repository to be submitted for evaluation followed by four essay-type question asking about candidate's statement of purpose(SOP), abilities, other achievements and motivation for applying in the form.<br>
The repo I submitted my research work under IASc-INSA-NASI Summer Research Fellowship during June-July 2023, that was "Detection of Hypertensive Retinopathy from fundoscopy images using DEEP LEARNING". For the Essay-type question, I wrote a raw draft of the answers and took help from one of my mentors and to improve them. And I submitted it before a month from the deadline and waited for the review mail for around 2 weeks.
