# Scribe: An Open-Source Solution for Language Learning and Data Accessibility

A language is not just a means of communication but a powerful tool for building understanding, cooperation, and unity across borders, fostering a more interconnected and empathetic environment. 

In today's globalized world, where communication spans across borders, acquiring a new language can be thrilling yet daunting. Navigating the elaborate grammar of German or the intricate verb conjugations of French may often necessitate additional assistance. There are many advantages to learning a new language. It boosts creative thinking and improves cognitive abilities. Learning multiple languages helps to increase vocabulary in both the foreign and native language. 

It also enhances cultural understanding, eases global communication, and strengthens global connections, making it a useful skill in today's interconnected world.

<!--- **Enter Scribe**: an open-source app that empowers language learners with real-time grammar, conjugation, and translation assistance, all integrated into your keyboard. Built on the power of open data from **Wikidata**, Scribe offers a practical solution to help users communicate confidently without needing to switch between multiple apps.

## Scribe and the FLOSS Community: Why Open Source Matters

At the heart of Scribe’s development is a strong commitment to the **FLOSS ethos**. Free and open-source software ensures that anyone can contribute, modify, and use the app freely. By making Scribe open source, the Scribe community believes the app can evolve through community contributions and grow to support an even wider range of languages and features.

The community's vision is simple yet powerful: 
**With open data from Wikidata and open-source contributions, Scribe will become a truly comprehensive tool for language learners around the world.**

Scribe’s development shows how the FLOSS community can drive innovation and create lasting tools for the benefit of all.

## How Scribe Works: A Key Product Overview

Scribe currently offers a range of tools that make it a standout in the language learning space:

- **Scribe iOS Keyboard Extension**: This keyboard allows users to check noun genders, conjugate verbs, and get preposition case hints directly from their smartphone keyboard. It integrates seamlessly with apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and email clients.

- **Scribe-Data**: Scribe utilizes data from **Wikidata’s lexicographical data** to provide accurate grammar and language assistance. Through a series of saved **SPARQL queries**, the app pulls information about nouns, verbs, and word forms, storing them as compact **JSON files**. This allows Scribe to work offline, delivering an efficient and responsive experience.

- **The Vision for Android and Desktop**: Though Scribe is currently only available for iOS, there are ambitious plans to bring the app to **Android and desktop platforms**, using technologies like Kotlin and Rust. This expansion would allow even more users to benefit from Scribe’s powerful language tools.
