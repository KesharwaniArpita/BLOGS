# Scribe: An Open-Source Solution for Language Learning and Data Accessibility

In a world where languages connect us across borders, learning a new language can be both exciting and challenging. Whether it's the complex grammar of German or the nuanced verb conjugations of French, navigating these rules often requires extra support. But what if there was a tool that helped you master these intricacies seamlessly, right from your phone?

**Enter Scribe**: an open-source app that empowers language learners with real-time grammar, conjugation, and translation assistance, all integrated into your keyboard. Built on the power of open data from **Wikidata**, Scribe offers a practical solution to help users communicate confidently without needing to switch between multiple apps.

## What is Scribe?

Scribe is an innovative language learning tool, currently available as an iOS keyboard extension, that provides real-time grammar and translation assistance for seven languages: **French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish**, and **Swedish**. Whether you're chatting in WhatsApp or writing an email, Scribe offers in-app support to help you manage noun genders, verb conjugations, and even prepositions, saving you from grammar headaches.

But Scribe is more than just a tool for language learners—it’s part of the **FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software)** movement, which champions community collaboration, transparency, and accessibility.

## Scribe and the FLOSS Community: Why Open Source Matters

At the heart of Scribe’s development is a strong commitment to the **FLOSS ethos**. Free and open-source software ensures that anyone can contribute, modify, and use the app freely. By making Scribe open source, **Andrew McAllister**—the creator of Scribe—believes the app can evolve through community contributions and grow to support an even wider range of languages and features.

Andrew’s vision is simple but powerful: 
> “With open data from Wikidata and open-source contributions, Scribe will become a truly comprehensive tool for language learners around the world.”

Scribe’s development shows how the FLOSS community can drive innovation and create lasting tools for the benefit of all.

## How Scribe Works: A Key Product Overview

Scribe currently offers a range of tools that make it a standout in the language learning space:

- **Scribe iOS Keyboard Extension**: This keyboard allows users to check noun genders, conjugate verbs, and get preposition case hints directly from their smartphone keyboard. It integrates seamlessly with apps like WhatsApp, Signal, and email clients.

- **Scribe-Data**: Scribe utilizes data from **Wikidata’s lexicographical data** to provide accurate grammar and language assistance. Through a series of saved **SPARQL queries**, the app pulls information about nouns, verbs, and word forms, storing them as compact **JSON files**. This allows Scribe to work offline, delivering an efficient and responsive experience.

- **The Vision for Android and Desktop**: Though Scribe is currently only available for iOS, there are ambitious plans to bring the app to **Android and desktop platforms**, using technologies like Kotlin and Python. This expansion would allow even more users to benefit from Scribe’s powerful language tools.
